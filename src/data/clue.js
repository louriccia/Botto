Its awkward skeletal body slowly lurches out toward you. Its hand and fingers are like branches. It reaches out next to you and you tuck your hood over your face.\n\nIt flicks a switch on the holotable and the room lights up. Slowly, you lift your hood and look up at the creature. In the light, you see its magnificently striped, yet curious body. It slowly nods at you and motions to the scrap along the walls.\n\nCautiously, you get back on your feet and slowly move to the outer wall. You are afraid to break eye-contact with the creature. Again, it nods and waves you to the scrap wall, making no noise. \n\nYou finally break line of sight and see, amidst the now lit up piles of scrap, in stunning condition, a Block 6. You can't believe your eyes. \n\nYou finally break the silence. \"F-For me? I can take this?\" You say while touching the Block 6.\n\nThe creature gracefully moves to the vault door. It flips open a panel with its gangly extremity, punches in a code, and the vault door opens. It steps aside and waves you out. \n\n\"T-Taa baa.\" you say, for what could be the first time in your life. \n\nThe creature nods in approval. \n\n---\n\nYou never thought you'd be so happy to see the twin suns and the endless sands. You stop to take a break pulling the Block 6 with your makeshift sleigh. \n\n\"Come in! Come in!\" You shout over your communicator.\n\n*\"Jonk, is that you?!\"* You hear Dube's voice.\n\n\"It's me you son of a Hutt!\" you say, filled with relief.\n\n*\"Where the fark have you been? Some sleemo crashed into the sandcrawler! We need you here now!\"*\n\n\"What?\"\n\n*\"We've got scrap! I repeat - we've got scrap!\"*"
